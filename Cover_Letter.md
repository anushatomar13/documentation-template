Hi, I am Anusha Tomar, a sophomore pursuing electronics and communication engineering with artificial intelligence at Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, New Delhi, India. I am a Google Women Engineers Scholar, a Grace Hopper Celebration Scholar, a Harvard WECode Scholar, and a recipient of the Harvard College Project for Asian and International Relations (HPAIR). 
I am deeply interested in artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. I have built several projects on AI/ML and am currently exploring blockchain technology. Talking about open-source, I have always been drawn to it. The primary reason for this is the fantastic and supportive community that one gets to be a part of while working on an open-source project, the opportunity to learn by contributing our ideas to the respective project, the chance to know about the ideas of other contributors, and expand our horizons of knowledge. 
I am interested in participating in the Linux Foundation's LFX Mentorship program because it will provide me with an incredible opportunity to contribute directly to some fantastic open-source projects while being mentored by experienced professionals in the field.

### I am particularly interested in the 'Hyperledger Caliper documentation platform update.' 

## Technical Writing and Documentation Skills:
I have worked on improving documentation for various projects, gaining experience in restructuring content, improving writing styles, and making documentation more user-friendly. Through these experiences, I have developed a keen understanding of best practices in technical documentation, such as clarity, conciseness, and catering to the target audience's needs. I am well-versed in tools like Markdown, Document360, and Nuclino, enabling me to contribute efficiently to the Caliper documentation.

## Blockchain and Hyperledger Ecosystem:
As someone deeply interested in blockchain technology, I am excited by the prospect of gaining in-depth knowledge about Hyperledger Caliper, its architecture, use cases, and its role within the broader Hyperledger ecosystem. Being selected as a blockchain technology and documentation contributor at Oraichain Season of Docs would be a valuable addition to my experience. While my primary focus will be documentation, interacting with Hyperledger technologies will give me a practical understanding of blockchain principles and applications.

## Open Source Collaboration:
I am well-versed in Git and GitHub and have actively contributed to open-source projects through platforms like Hacktoberfest and Girl Script Summer of Code. I have experience adhering to contribution guidelines, participating in community discussions, and collaborating with developers and technical writers to gather information and receive feedback. This project will further enhance my open-source collaboration skills. Moreover, my ongoing experience as a contributor in Oraichain Season of Docs, where I contribute to the documentation of various blockchain-based projects, would be an added advantage while contributing to the Hyperledger Caliper documentation platform update.
One of the critical aspects that drew me to this project is its focus on technical documentation. I have a keen interest in technical writing and have actively worked on improving the documentation of various projects. For instance, I have contributed to writing multiple blogs on blockchain and web3 during my contribution period in Hacktoberfest and Girl Script Summer of code last year.

#### My merged PRs:
##### Improved writing structure of a blockchain blog: https://github.com/Vikash-8090-Yadav/Future.WebNet/pull/516
##### Added a blog on Polygon: https://github.com/Vikash-8090-Yadav/Future.WebNet/pull/518

#### I also proposed some changes in the documentation of Moja Global, an open-source organization; I contributed to enhancing their documentation by restructuring the content, improving the writing style, and making it more user-friendly and engaging.
#### My PRs:
##### Improved structure and highlighted important terms: https://github.com/moja-global/moja_global_docs/pull/211
##### FLINT page changes: https://github.com/moja-global/moja_global_docs/pull/212

Even though my pull requests were not merged with Moja Global due to inactivity in the community, I took the initiative to personally reach out to some community members. They reviewed my proposed changes and provided valuable feedback, suggesting I familiarize myself with specific technical documentation software and tools. This experience taught me the importance of actively seeking guidance and input and continuously improving my technical documentation writing skills.
Following their feedback, I learned technical documentation software and tools like Markdown, Document360, Nuclino, etc. My expertise in these tools would help me more efficiently contribute to the Hyperledger Caliper documentation. 

### Additional skills that I possess: 
Additionally, my proficiency in both English and French would allow me to review and potentially contribute to translating the documentation, making it more accessible to a wider global audience. While improving the documentation for Hyperledger Caliper, one of my primary focuses would be to make sure the wording is gender-neutral, inclusive, and welcoming to all users, regardless of their background or identity, as inclusive language is crucial in creating a welcoming environment that promotes diversity and encourages participation from a wide range of individuals.

Through this mentorship project, I aim to contribute to the standardization and content improvement efforts of the Caliper documentation. I strive to ensure the documentation is accessible, consistent, and comprehensive, covering all aspects of Caliper, including installation, configuration, usage, and troubleshooting, with up-to-date and accurate information.

My unique technical skills, open-source experience, technical writing abilities, passion for blockchain technology, and eagerness to learn make me an excellent fit for this project. I am excited to contribute my knowledge and expertise, learn from experienced mentors, and play a role in enhancing the user experience and adoption of this powerful blockchain tool.
